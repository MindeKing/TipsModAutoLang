# TipsModAutoLang
Batch script designed for Darkhax's "Tips" mod for Minecraft.

Simply provide a list of loading screen tip titles, and the script will create all the files and reference keys you need, all referenced in one easy-to-edit language file.

Highly configurable.

Still under development, but I wanted to get a head-start on the GitHub page.
