# TipsModAutoLang
Batch script designed for Darkhax's "Tips" mod for Minecraft.

Made specifically with "Tips-fabric-1.21.1-21.1.2" as a reference, but I have no reason to believe it shouldn't work for other versions of the mod since this script is so simple in its opperation.

Simply provide a list of loading screen tip titles, and the script will create all the files and reference keys you need, all referenced in one easy-to-edit language file.

Highly configurable.

Still under development, but I wanted to get a head-start on the GitHub page.
